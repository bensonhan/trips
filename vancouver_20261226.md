# Vancouver, BC: The Winter Edition Travel Guide

Vancouver in December is magical, filled with holiday lights and mountain snow, though you should prepare for frequent rain in the city. This guide is adjusted for a winter visit and focuses on staying warm, dry, and making the most of seasonal attractions.

## I. Itinerary

### Day 1: Holiday Lights & Island Bites
- **Morning:** Bundle up for Stanley Park. While the Seawall might be breezy, the *Bright Nights* Christmas Train is a must-see. If it's raining heavily, spend your morning inside the Vancouver Aquarium.
- **Afternoon:** Take the Aquabus to Granville Island—perfect for hiding from the rain. Explore the Net Loft for unique holiday gifts and grab a hot bowl of seafood chowder at the Public Market.
- **Evening:** Visit the Vancouver Christmas Market at Jack Poole Plaza. Enjoy German glühwein (mulled wine), bratwurst, and the artisan carousel.

### Day 2: Winter Wonderland
- **Morning:** Head to North Vancouver for *Canyon Lights* at Capilano Suspension Bridge. In December the park is decorated with hundreds of thousands of lights. Tip: go early or late afternoon to see dusk turn into night.
- **Afternoon:** Take the shuttle to Grouse Mountain. At the *Peak of Christmas* you can go ice skating on an outdoor pond, visit a reindeer habitat, or walk through the Light Tunnel.
- **Evening:** Warm up in Gastown—historic architecture + winter lights. Find a cozy booth at a local gastropub to escape the chill.

### Day 3: Indoor Culture & Cozy Corners
- **Morning:** Visit the Museum of Anthropology (MOA) or the Vancouver Art Gallery to stay dry while soaking in world-class art.
- **Afternoon:** Explore Main Street or the West End. Stop into ramen shops like **Danbo** or **Maruhachi** for a steaming bowl of noodles—the ultimate Vancouver winter tradition.

### Day 4: Mountains & Scenic Day Trip
- **Morning:** Drive the Sea-to-Sky Highway toward Squamish. Stop at Shannon Falls and take the Sea to Sky Gondola for short hikes and panoramic views—winter mornings are best for clearer roads and views.
- **Afternoon:** Continue to Whistler for skiing, snowboarding, or exploring Whistler Village. Prefer a shorter trip? Stay local with Lynn Canyon and Deep Cove—great for a relaxed, scenic day and cozy cafés.
- **Evening:** Unwind with a spa visit (Scandinave Spa is a popular option in Whistler) or enjoy a hearty mountain-side dinner; if you return to the city, try a brewery or gastropub for a low-key evening.

**Tip:** Allow 1.5–2 hours each way to Whistler; check winter road conditions, book shuttles or guided day tours if you prefer not to drive, and reserve rentals/lessons in advance during peak season.

## IV. December Travel Tips
- **Dress like a local:** Waterproof shells (Arc'teryx) + Blundstone boots. Umbrellas often get wrecked by wind—waterproof footwear is essential.
- **Plan around light:** It gets dark early (around 4:15 PM). Save scenic views for the morning and "light" attractions for late afternoon and evening.
- **Book ahead:** December is heavy with holiday parties—reserve restaurants 2–3 weeks in advance when possible.
- **Expect rain, not city snow:** The city usually rains rather than snows, though the mountains will have plenty of snow. If driving to the mountains, ensure M+S or winter tires.
